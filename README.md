(NOTE: CQ versions 5.4 and 5.5 should work as well -- CQ was renamed to AEM as of version 5.6). Included are recipes to install an author or publish instance as well as the dispatcher module for Apache HTTP server.

## Supported Platforms

* CentOS
* Ubuntu / Debian

## Supported Versions

* AEM 6.0.0
* AEM 5.6.1
* AEM 5.6.0
* CQ 5.5.0

## Featured Functionality

* Unattended installation of aem author, publish, and dispatcher nodes.
* Automatically search for and configure aem cluster members (dispatcher, author, publish) using chef searches.
* Configure replication agents using the replicator provider.
* Configure dispatcher farms with the farm provider.
* Deploy and remove aem packages with the package provider (recommended for development purposes only).
